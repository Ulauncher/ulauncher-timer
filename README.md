## Basic usage

### Time formats

The timer extension accepts times in two formats:

- Time duration in hours, minutes, and/or seconds
- Time of day (absolute time in the next 24 hours)

#### Examples

##### Time duration
- `3m` = 3 minutes
- `5h` = 5 hours
- `2m30s` = 2 minutes and 30 seconds

##### Time of day
- `1:30pm` = 1:30 PM
- `720a` = 7:20 AM

### Persistent timer mode

Choose _Alert periodically until closed_ in settings to make timers harder to
ignore. Close the timer notification to stop persistent timer notifications.
A timer can also be stopped by selecting it with Ulauncher.
